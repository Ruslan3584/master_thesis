We present an algorithm that can give a correct answer
to one of two questions for any \((\max,+)\)
labeling problem: either ``What is the best labeling?'' or
``Is the problem supermodular?''
Moreover, we prove that for every supermodular problem
the algorithm gives optimal labeling.
The algorithm is called self-driven because a user
cannot decide which of the two questions will be answered
--- this decision is up to the algorithm.
Also, the algorithm
does not need to know the order of labels if the problem is supermodular.
In this work, we describe the algorithm for integer weights of vertices
and edges and use subgradient descent
to guarantee the finite time of execution.
